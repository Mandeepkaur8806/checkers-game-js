# checkers-game-js
Developed an interactive Checkers game using JavaScript and HTML Canvas, implementing full game logic including piece movement, king promotion, jump detection, and turn‑based interactions. Designed an object‑oriented structure with a Piece constructor to manage state, validate moves, and update the board dynamically.
